# Style Guide

### Markdown
We only accept drafts in a MarkDown (.md) file. If you are not familiar with MarkDown files, [here is a great resource to get you started.](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/)

The MD editors we recommend are [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/editor) and [Dillinger](http://www.dillinger.io/). 

### English Language
The submission should be completely in English. Your English should be good enough to allow people to immediately dive into the content of your post and review your ideas, rather than your spelling and grammar.

### Titles and Subtitles
The post’s title will be H1 (#) when published. This means you should never use anything higher than ## (H2) in your draft. Keep your main section headings at ##. Sub-sections are ###, and so on.

Keep your headings short and effective – try for under 6 words.

Make sure you properly capitalize the title as well. Use [TitleCapitalization](http://titlecapitalization.com/) to ensure it is correct. 

(Add in the rest of the spelling and grammar section to the GitHub)

### Word Count
Try not to exceed 2000 words. **However,** your ideas and the way they are conveyed should be your biggest focus, not article length.

Word count does not include code. 

### Spelling, Grammar, Consistency and Acceptable Language
All articles published on SitePoint should be free of spelling and grammar mistakes. But we're all human and sometimes we miss little errors, so if you spot a mistake, please inform the editor. 

**Spelling:** 
- Please use a spell checker as you write. For example, a good resource is [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/).
- We use US spelling in all of our articles.

**Grammar:**
- Make sure you understand the difference between:
    - it's, its
    - your, you're
    - there, their, they're
    - to, too, two
- Company names - Capitilize according to the company’s style when writing about startups, companies and products. For example: SitePoint, WordPress, jQuery, iPhone, GitHub.
- Sentences that start with a lowercased company or product, like 'iPhone' or 'jQuery' should retain the style.
- Understand that a hyphen is not the same as a long dash. Hyphens are used for math and phone numbers, whereas long dashes are used at the start of an interjection in a sentence. 

**Consistency:**
- The structure and presentation of a sentence should be consistent throughout. For example, if you're listing actions and you use "running", the next action should be "jumping" (etc.) to match the form of the verb. 
- The same idea applies to tenses (past tense = "ran and jumped")
- Voice should be consistent as well. You are allowed to use "I", "We", "You", but it should be applied consistently throughout the article. 

**Acceptable Language:**
- Swearing is not permitted. 
- Do not use your article to attack any group or person. While there can be healthy rivalry between different web groups (eg: Ruby vs PHP vs JavaScript etc.), it should never become abusive.
- Any doubt that you have about a particular phrase, do not use it or consult your editor about it first.
