# Demos and Downloadable Code Samples

Most tutorials, and some articles, published on SitePoint will be enhanced with a demo of the code and its result. We have a number of services we use to embed demos into articles.

## GitHub

Most articles involve code samples hosted on GitHub. As an author, you should create a public repo with all the code used in an article and make this available to your editor. This repo should be linked to prominently in the article.

Once the repo is finalized, it will be forked to the SitePoint Editors repo to prevent code going missing or being altered after an article is published.

## CodePen

[CodePen](http://codepen.io/) is useful for front-end demos involving HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It includes a console for displaying output (but this unfortunately cannot yet be included in the embedded view).

If you decide to include a CodePen demo, this will need to be shared with the editor and linked to prominently in the article. We have an editor account that we use to embed these demos on the site.

## JSBin

[JSBin](https://jsbin.com/) is handy for displaying code samples that involve console output. This is something that CodePen doesn't currently support.

If you decide to include a JSBin demo, this will need to be shared with the editor and linked to prominently in the article. We have an editor account that we use to embed these demos on the site.

## Plunker

[Plunker](http://plnkr.co/) is ideal for demos that involve a larger number of files (such as an Angular app, or Ajax-based demos).

Plunker has a number of useful features. For example, readers can download zip files containing all of the files in a particular Plunk. It also supports several compile to JS languages (e.g. TypeScript), as well as module loaders. The embedded view provides an interface for readers to browse the different files in a demo.

If you decide to include a Plunker demo, this will need to be shared with the editor and linked to prominently in the article. We have an editor account that we use to embed these demos on the site.
